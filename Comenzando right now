An AI assistant is a digital tool or application that uses natural language processing 
(NLP) and machine learning to interact with users in a human-like way. They can interact
 with users through text or voice. AI assistants can be used to perform specific tasks, 
 answer questions, or carry out commands. They can be extremely effective in
  streamlining, automating and improving manual processes.
